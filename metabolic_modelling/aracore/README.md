[This](https://github.com/pwendering/ArabidopsisCoreModel/tree/master) repository by Philipp Wendering is very useful when working with AraCore. He gathered edits that people have made to AraCore over the years, and also provides some more information, including a translation table of metabolites to the SEED namespace. From there, they can be translated to any other namespace via MetaNetX (see translation_data).
