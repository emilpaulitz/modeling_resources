# reusable_resources_and_scripts

This is a repository to share resources and scripts among the group that took some time to gather or develop and could be re-used by your colleagues. Please think about if you obtained such resources and can contribute them.

Please document the resources in the folders README with the following information:
- Source: How and where did you obtain the resource?
- Usage: How can your colleagues use this resource? For scripts, maybe provide a package list or even a conda .yml etc. For resources, how are they structured? Maybe you also wrote a script to use the resource?
- And finally: the author. Give yourself credit for contributing :)
